# SHA256
A SHA256 hash function in Python 3.x.

A hash function does [not encrypt the data](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html). Once hashed, the hash cannot be decrypted.\
Collisions are when two or more strings generate the same output, and is\
possible because the function generates an ['almost' unique](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/29650/sha-256-almost-unique) output.
